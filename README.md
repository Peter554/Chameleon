# chameleon

This is chameleon game web app built using [socket.io](https://socket.io). 
A demo is served on heroku [here](https://chameleon-game-demo.herokuapp.com) (if you are the first user for a while there will be a delay while the server wakes up).

To play you need to get a group of people together and all join the same game room.
After this you choose a word grid and assign player roles. All players except one are given the key word. 
The player left out is the 'chameleon' - it is their role to blend in and not be caught out!
Players then go round in a circle, taking turns to say just one word, which should relate to the key word in some way.
After this players must vote on who they thought the chameleon was. Who's word didn't quite fit? If the group fails to catch the chameleon then the chameleon has won that round.
However, if the chameleon is caught they then get one chance to guess what the key word was. Should they guess right then the chameleon still wins! 
If they guess wrong the other players have won. This rule is key to the enjoyment of the game - can you make a clue word that strikes the right balance? Too obvious and the chameleon will catch on. Too vague and you risk being accused yourself!  

Feedback and pull requests welcome.
